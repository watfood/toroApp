# The Mission 
My mission was to build and emulate a solid Stock Market application.  While there are many out there, I hoped to bring in all the utility and simplicty of the best applications out there while bringing and clean sense of design and ease of use.  After learning to build a solid stock app, I'd like to continue use that knowledge to hopefully improve upon what was built previously.


# Why Stocks?

According the Wall Street Journal, while the richest country, the United States ranks 14th when it comes to financial literacy.  Much of that is due to financial literacy not being place in the forefront while the knowledge of wealth being consolidated to a minority few, aka the 1 percent. I believe that finance, stocks, real estate, investment vehicles and knowledge of the energy systems which power the world is a first step to being free of it and to be financially free.


# The Approach

Technologies, the internet & apps such has Motif Investing, Think or Swim, Mint, StockTwits etc + the power of social media have helped me gain and greater knowledge & appreciaton of the markets.  While there are many others out there with deeper information, it was really the ellegance, simplicity of each of these apps which made the experience easier to absorb and enjoy. I hope to learn from these examples while building apps of this type and implment a similar feeling of easy to understand and use.
